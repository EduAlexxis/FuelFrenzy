        <h2 class="TitleNew">"Yes to electric cars—but not the Hummer EV"</h2>
        <p>The Hummer EV is an environmental disaster, and it should be treated as one
</p>
        <p>The Hummer is back, and this time it's electric. But is it really a step forward for the environment and public health, or a disaster in disguise? The new Hummer EV is bigger and heavier than its gas-guzzling predecessor, and its enormous battery contains large amounts of critical ingredients like lithium that are in short supply. Not to mention, its added weight will apply extra force in a collision, putting pedestrians, cyclists, and those in normal-size cars at risk. Plus, the Hummer EV's battery consumes so much power that it generates more carbon per mile than a gas-powered Chevy Malibu.</p>

<p>But is this really the right move for the environment and society as a whole? With smaller EVs being better for the planet and public health, an enlightened government would utilize regulations and tax policy to manage vehicle size and nudge the industry toward smaller models.

So, is the Hummer EV a monstrosity that need not exist? Click that button and read on to find out more.</p>

        <h2 class="TitleNew">"Shifting to EVs is not enough. The deeper problem is our car dependence"</h2>
        <p>As the world grapples with the ongoing climate crisis, governments are under increasing pressure to take action to reduce emissions and tackle the root causes of global warming. In Canada, the government has made a strong push towards the adoption of electric vehicles as part of its strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While electric vehicles produce fewer emissions than their gas-powered counterparts, the focus on them as the solution to climate change is misguided and overlooks the deeper problem of car dependence.
</p>
        <p>The dominance of cars in our communities is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental and health problems. Car-centric policies and infrastructure have incentivized suburban living and prioritized cars above other forms of mobility.
