        <h1>"Yes to electric cars—but not the Hummer EV"</h1>
        <img class="newse" src="hum1.jpg" alt="Electric car">
        <section class="article751">

<p>For those looking to reduce their carbon footprint and help the environment, electric cars seem like a logical solution. However, as with any technology, there are concerns that arise as they become more mainstream. One such issue is the size and weight of electric cars. The new Hummer EV, for example, is an environmental and societal disaster, and it is a warning about how car electrification could go off the rails if regulators give Detroit a free hand.</p>

<p>The original Hummer was inspired by the U.S. military’s High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, popularly known as the Humvee, which was deployed in the 1989 invasion of Panama and the 1990-’91 Gulf War. The first civilian Hummer, the H1, arrived in 1992, and General Motors acquired rights to the brand a few years later. The final gas-powered model, the H3, weighed a little under 5,000 pounds and received the EPA’s lowest possible greenhouse gas rating for its 14 miles per gallon. It ceased production in 2010.</p>

<p>Now, the Hummer is back with an electrified version, and it’s even bigger and more massive than before. The Hummer EV is roughly 2½ feet longer, 6 inches taller, and a couple of inches wider than its gas-guzzling predecessor, and it tips the scales at just over 9,000 pounds, equivalent to around three Toyota Corollas. The added weight of the Hummer EV poses a danger to those who walk, bike, or travel in normal-sized cars, as the added weight will apply extra force in a collision. Worse, the high front end of the Hummer EV makes it more likely to strike a person’s torso instead of their legs, increasing the risk of serious injury or death.</p>

<p>Even though the Hummer EV is electric, it doesn't necessarily help fight climate change. Moving a vehicle weighing 4 ½ tons requires a tremendous amount of power, which calls for a very big battery. The one inside the Hummer EV weighs nearly 3,000 pounds, as much as an entire Honda Civic. Charging that battery requires lots of electricity, which itself creates emissions. In fact, the Hummer EV’s battery consumes so much power that the vehicle generates more carbon per mile than a gas-powered Chevy Malibu. The Hummer EV’s enormous battery contains large amounts of critical ingredients like lithium that are in short supply. Scarcity of such material is already raising the price of batteries, presenting an obstacle to electrifying transportation.</p>

<p>Apart from the Hummer EV’s impact on climate change, its immense weight also generates more particulate emissions from tire friction, which causes health problems when inhaled. And it produces more road damage, since heavier vehicles inflict much greater wear and tear on pavement. The Hummer EV seems to offer no societal benefits, electric though it is.</p>

<p>Despite its drawbacks, GM has already found plenty of people willing to pay the Hummer EV’s $110,000 sticker price. As of July, customers had placed over 77,000 orders, but only a few hundred Hummers had been produced. Demand has exceeded supply so much that one vehicle recently sold at auction for $324,500.</p>

<p>The Biden administration has made the questionable decision to help stoke consumer interest in the Hummer EV. President Biden himself took a spin in a Hummer EV last year, and in June, the U.S. Department of Transportation featured the Hummer EV at an electrification showcase held outside its D.C. headquarters. However, the administration's free marketing for the Hummer EV reflects a troubling pattern among Democratic officials in Washington, whose enthusiasm for electrification seems to override any concerns about the toll that gigantic EVs impose on society and the planet.</p>
